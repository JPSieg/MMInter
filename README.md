## A.) Overview

All raw data, code, and intermediate files for the manuscript "Divalent metal cation-metabolite interaction model reveals cation buffering and speciation".

Interaction coefficents were parsed out of a MySQL formatted version of NIST46 provided by Dr. Donald R. Burgess Jr. available at:
