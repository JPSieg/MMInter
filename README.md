## A.) Overview

All raw data, code, and intermediate files for the manuscript "Divalent metal cation-metabolite interaction model reveals cation buffering and speciation".

Interaction coefficents were parsed out of a MySQL formatted version of NIST46 provided by Dr. Donald R. Burgess Jr. available at:

https://doi.org/10.18434/M32154

Apparant dissacociation constants were estimated from absolute interaction coefficients with corrections for ionic strength and pH using code from https://github.com/JPSieg/MetaboMgITC.

SVG formatted figures were worked up with Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) and exported to high-resolution pngs.
